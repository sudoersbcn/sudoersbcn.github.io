A Unix sysadmins group from Barcelona area that meet once a month. The meeting format is very classic: a video projector, a couple of presentations from the participants and as many questions the better.
And do we need another meeting of geeks? There are already groups that meet regularly to talk about technology, but the nexus is usually a specific programming language. As sysadmins we always missed a lot of topics that often fall outside of developer&amp;rsquo;s scope.</description></item></channel></rss>
