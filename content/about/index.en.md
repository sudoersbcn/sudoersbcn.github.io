## What is it?
A Unix sysadmins group from Barcelona area that meet once a month. The meeting format is very classic: a video projector, a couple of presentations from the participants and as many questions the better.

## And do we need another meeting of geeks?
There are already groups that meet regularly to talk about technology, but the nexus is usually a specific programming language. As sysadmins we always missed a lot of topics that often fall outside of developer's scope. 

If you feel like talking about issues related with Unix system administration, devops, scalability... come to the next meeting.

## When?
Usually the first working Tuesday of each month, except on August, when we do a social meeting.
